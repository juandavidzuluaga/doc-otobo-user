State Pre-selection for Templates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ‘State Pre-selection for Templates’ functionality introduces an administrative module that enhances the efficiency of ticket responses by allowing administrators to associate specific response templates with predefined states. This ensures that when a user replies to a ticket using one of these templates, the associated state is automatically preselected, streamlining the response process.
