AdminDynamicField
=================

From the dynamic fields module in the filtering widget, fields for filtering are observed:

Filter for Namespaces
------------------------
In this field, the values of Namespaces that have been configured appear, and you can filter by the dynamic fields associated with the selected value.

Cloning of Dynamic Fields

It is now possible to clone the configuration of dynamic fields from the "Clone" column located in the list of fields.

Clicking on the icon opens a screen with the same configuration as the selected field.
