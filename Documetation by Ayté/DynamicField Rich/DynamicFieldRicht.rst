   Default Value
In the settings, the rich text editor is observed, allowing for the possibility of adding a default value for the field. This way, when viewing a screen directly, the default text is displayed, and in article forms or ticket creation, this default text can be edited.


Field Display
------------------
After saving the field and publishing it on the AgenTicketZoom screen, the RichText article-type field is displayed in the article information if the form in which the article was created was published and the field was used.
